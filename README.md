### guides
Centralized support hub created for the Information Technology department to assist GateWay Community College employees.

The purpose of this centralized hub is to provide IT technicians quicker and easier access to reference guides.  While the current url is [anyssaiwamoto.com/gatewayguides](https://www.anyssaiwamoto.com/gatewayguides/), the proposed url for internal IT, and perhaps external GateWay, implementation would be learn.gatewaycc.edu using an administrative account rather than my personal account for longevity.

The current platform utilized for sharing and accessing tutorials is the [Gecko Portal (SharePoint)](https://maricopa.sharepoint.com/sites/gwc_it/SitePages/Reference-Guides.aspx?web=1).  Maricopa credentials are required to access this site making some tutorials inaccessible.  For example, there's a tutorial guiding employees on resetting their Maricopa password.
